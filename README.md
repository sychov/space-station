## What's this?

An attempt to make some multiplayer social game, inspired by wonderful project "Station 13".
Sad, but now I have no time to spend for this project. But I'll have it later and finish this! I hope to, at least...

## Great thanks to:

 * people, who create excellent game-dev instruments, such as Tiled and PyGame;
 * some children, especially my 8 y.o. daughter, who help me in game map and some graphics drawing;
 * all people, who draw free tiles used in game, and write a free music;
 * people, who make wonderful animated characters. I don't know who are you, guys, and I'm not sure, that this graphics is free, but if you will be angry of using yours graphics here, I'll remove it immediately!

## Demo (packed by Pyinstaller):

For now, user interface is very unfriendly :)

Use:
 * arrows to move around; 
 * keys "Z"-"X"-"C" for "help"-"force"-"use" commands;
 * key "I" for pseudo-inventory open/close;
 * mouse for UI windows moving and resizing, drag-n-drop items.

Functionality is very limited, cause I was focusing on basis building.

 ## Of course, some screenshots:
