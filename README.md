## What's this?

An attempt to make some multiplayer social game, inspired by wonderful project "Station 13".
Sad, but now I have no time to spend for this project. But I'll have it later and finish this! I hope to, at least...

## Great thanks to:

 * people, who create excelent game-dev instruments, such as Tiled and PyGame;
 * some children, especially my 8 y.o. dauther, who help me in game map and some graphics drawing;
 * all people, who draw free tiles used in game, and write a free music;
 * people, who make wonderful animated characters. I don't know who are you, guys, and I'm not sure, that this graphics is free, but if you will be angry of using yours graphics here, I'll remove it immidiately!
